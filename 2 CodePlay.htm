    First of all I would like to give brief <strong>Description</strong></b> about channel - <br>
    <i>
        
        CodePlay is platform , as name sounds, for <strong>learning to code</strong>, especially for beginners. In today's time , its too convenient to learn like everything while sitting in comfort zone  and from anywhere. But every coin has two faces. So, online courses are expensive too. Minimum price of some  courses on reputed platform are even more than $100.Whlie I was learning to code being a student, its not easy to ask for such huge money and many parents too find it difficult to pay for education in this crucial time .
        I also faced same issue so I decided to help others and to get quality content and that to free of cost
        Factor differentiating CodePlay from other free resources is - <strong>3B
            From the Beginner , By the Beginner ,and for the Beginner.</strong>
