Well , in index while linking courses.htm 'Contact Us.htm' or CodePlay.htm we link these htm files just by writing their names
bcz they are in same folder


to be exact , upto now we have linked files available in our Laptop only and these cannot be accessed by any other computer
so these files are present relative to index.htm or vice-versa for this system but not for others
----So , it is relative path
e.g b- 
        HTML/Contact Us.htm


Relative  Path -- Exact path of file that any program can access 
e.g- 
        /home/codeplay/Documents/Web Development/HTML/Contact Us.htm
