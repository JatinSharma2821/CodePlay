<!-- After entering data in form , when we click on <input type="submit"> , a sudden change in url is seen  
    ,and initial url it adds our all entered data alongwioth name attribute value

    It is sort of query string trying to store data with 'name attribute value' as field -->

    <!--
    firstname=abc&lastname=def&birthday-date=1111-11-21&gen=on&email=dfgrs%40dvknds.com&username=fbsdcvb&password=dvcnsdlvndsln&password=name%3D"password"&number=15315641861    
    >> simplying above url , we get following data - 

        firstname=abc
        &lastname=def
        &birthday-date=1111-11-21

        &gen=on 
        // see here it shows gen=on and not the option that we selected bcz we didnt use value attribute
        // with type=radio , value is must for each option
        

        &email=dfgrs%40dvknds.com
        &username=fbsdcvb
        &password=dvcnsdlvndsln
        &password=name%3D"password"
        &number=15315641861

        in order to store <select> tag information , we require <name> attribute , 
            so don't forget to include name attribute , otherwise info won't be saved
    

    Hence-->

    <!-- It is called Query String
    It is one way for us ,to store our information in backend or server
    because we have to store this information somewhere
    so that when we come again on this page, website remembers us 

    Although we are using <forn> tag only but by default
        <form> == <form method="GET" -- GET attribute , attachs form info to URL , we can see Query String-->

    <!--
        <form method="POST" -- POST attachs form data with body of request , so we cannot see any change in URL
    -->
